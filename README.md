# To-do-list


By default, when you come to the page, you are welcomed to the home page, or default to-do list with title "Today".

The user can add and delete items from a list and can make new lists.

Users can create as many links for every todo task. For example, localhost:8000/gym will create a todolist specific to gym todos. Users will not lose their data unless they delete it themselves, data is stored with MongoDB Cloud.
